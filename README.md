SlipGuard Detailed Features Overview User Roles & Permissions 1️⃣Student
• View slip status & violations. • Request violation slips (if required). • Use QR Code for entry. • Receive notifications for approvals, rejections, and slip expiry. 2️⃣Guard
• Scan QR codes for verification. • Approve or reject entry with reasons. • Manually log violations for students without QR slips. • Track flagged students who exceed violation limits. 3️⃣Admin �� • Approve/reject slip requests. • Set slip expiration rules (default: 2️4 hours from first scan). • Manage violation limits per semester. • Configure auto-approval rules. • Monitor flagged students & security alerts. • View audit logs for system transparency. QR Code-Based Slip System Auto-Approved Slips • Students below X violations per semester get pre-approved slips (QR code always active). • Each scan reduces the available slip count. • If no more pre-approved slips are available, students must manually request a slip. Violation Slips (Admin-Approved) • For students exceeding the violation limit, slips must be requested manually. • Admin reviews and decides on approval/rejection. • Once approved, the slip activates upon first scan. One-Day Expiration (After First Scan) • A slip becomes valid only after it is scanned for the first time. • The slip expires 24 hours after the first scan. • Guards cannot scan expired slips. Slip Status Indicators • Active Slip → Available for use. • Expired Slip → Cannot be used. • Pending Approval → Waiting for admin decision. • Rejected → Student must visit the Guidance Office. Slip Request & Violation Management Slip Request Workflow 1️. Select reason (e.g., lost ID, medical, official activity). 2️. Request goes to Admin Dashboard for review. 3️. Approval → Slip is generated. 4. Rejection → Student is notified and redirected to Guidance Office. Violation Tracking • Violations are recorded per semester. • If a student exceeds X violations, slips require manual approval. • If a student is rejected 3 times at the gate, they must report to the Guidance Office. Manual Violation Logging (Guards Only) • Guards can log violations for students without QR slips. • The system auto-checks if the student has exceeded violations. Admin Dashboard Features Real-Time Request Monitoring • View pending, approved, rejected, and expired slips. • Track flagged students who exceed violations. Slip Expiry & Custom Duration • Default slip validity = 2️4 hours after first scan. • Admin can extend duration for special cases (e.g., medical excuses). Violation & Auto-Approval Settings • Define maximum violations per semester before requiring manual approval. • Configure auto-approval rules based on violation count or slip history. Audit Logging & Security • Every approval, rejection, scan, and violation log is recorded for transparency. • Ensures accountability and prevents abuse. Alerts & Notifications • Students receive notifications for slip status updates. • Guards are alerted when scanning flagged students. Firestore Database Structure Users Collection (users*) • Each user has a document with their details. • Document ({userId}): o name: string o role: "admin" | "guard" | "student" o email: string o createdAt: timestamp o hasActiveSlip: boolean (True if slip is active: scanned/approved) o remainingSlips: number (Auto-approved slips left, resets per semester) o totalViolations: number (Accumulated violations for the semester) Student Details (studentDetails Subcollection) • Only for students. Each student has their own document. • Document ({studentId}): o yearLevel: string o section: string o slipStatus: "expired" | "none" | "approved" | "pending" | "active" o violationCount: number (Count of violations for the semester) Violations (violations Subcollection) • Each student can have multiple violations recorded. • Document ({violationId}): o type: string o description: string o date: timestamp o status: "pending" | "resolved" Violation Slip Requests (violationSlipRequests) • Tracks requests for violation slips. • Document ({requestId}): o studentId: string o reason: string o status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected" o requestedAt: timestamp o reviewedBy: string (Admin ID) o firstScanAt: timestamp (null until scanned) o expiresAt: timestamp (null until scanned) o slipType: "auto-approved" | "requested" Violations Collection (violations) • Independent record of all violations. • Document ({violationId}): o studentId: string o type: string o description: string o status: "pending" | "resolved" o recordedBy: string (Guard ID) o recordedAt: timestamp Audit Logs (auditLogs) • Records actions taken by admins and guards. • Document ({logId}): o action: "approve" | "reject" | "flag" | "resolve" | "scan" o performedBy: string (Admin/Guard ID) o timestamp: timestamp o details: string Auto-Approval Rules (autoApprovalRules) • Admin-defined rules for auto-approval. • Document ({ruleId}): o condition: "violationCount" | "slipHistory" o threshold: number o autoApprove: boolean System Configurations (systemConfigs) • Stores system-wide settings. • Document ({configId}****): o semesterStart: timestamp (Used to reset violation/slip counts) o semesterEnd: timestamp o violationLimit: number (Threshold before requiring manual slip approval) o slipValidityDuration: number (default: 2️4 hours) Error Handling & Edge Cases Common Error Scenarios: 1️. Scan post-24h with 0 slips: Slip status changes to "expired," and student receives a notification ("Slip quota exhausted"). 2️. Attempt to reuse expired slip: System blocks the scan and notifies the student ("This slip is no longer valid"). 3️. Network failure during deduction: Scan is queued for retry, and the student is notified ("Scan will complete when online"). User Notifications Student Notifications: • Slip Rejected: Sent via Push, SMS ("Reason for rejection"). • Violation Threshold Reached: Email and in-app alert ("Manual approval required"). • Slip Expired: Push notification ("New request needed"). • Account Flagged: SMS and Email alert ("Visit Guidance Office"). Guard Alerts: • Expired QR Scan: Sound + red flash alert. • Flagged Student: Vibration + modal alert. • System Failure: Persistent banner. • Double Scan Attempt: Warning toast notification. Admin Alerts: • Violation Spike: Email + dashboard bell. • System Config Changed: Slack/Teams notification. • Manual Override Used: Audit log entry. • Failed Scan Sync: Error report after 3️ retries. Audit Log & Security Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): • Students: View their own logs. • Guards: Cannot view logs, only create. • Admins: View, export, and manage all logs. Security Measures: • Immutability: Logs are cryptographically protected to prevent tampering. • Automated Security Checks: Detect anomalies like rapid scan attempts or unusual locations.

Integration of React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, and RadixUI
React
React will be used as the primary library for building the user interface components. It will handle the rendering of the UI and manage the state of the application.

Next.js
Next.js will be used as the framework for server-side rendering and routing. It will provide the structure for the application, handle routing, and enable server-side rendering for better performance and SEO.

TailwindCSS
TailwindCSS will be used for styling the application. It will provide utility-first CSS classes that can be applied directly to the HTML elements to style them.

Shadcn
Shadcn will be used for creating custom components and managing the component library. It will help in building reusable and consistent UI components across the application.

RadixUI
RadixUI will be used for building accessible and customizable UI components. It will provide a set of low-level primitives that can be used to create complex and accessible UI components.

Examples of Integration
React and Next.js: React components will be used within Next.js pages to build the UI. Next.js will handle the routing and server-side rendering of these pages.
TailwindCSS and Shadcn: Custom components created with Shadcn will be styled using TailwindCSS utility classes to ensure a consistent design.
RadixUI and Shadcn: RadixUI primitives will be used to enhance the accessibility of custom components built with Shadcn.
